Soft Length Limit

This module provides a counter that indicates the maximum recommended
characters in a certain text field. This means the user will be warned if the
content length of the field is exceeded, but will still be able to pass content
validation and be persisted in the relevant storage.

This module adds the following features:

* Lets the user configure any instance of a text field's widget, to have a
  specific soft limit. This is done in the "Manage Form Display" page of the
  relevant entity type. This counter will always be shown on fields with a soft
  limit.
